It seems as though VICE does something weird and truncates commands to the shortest recent command length regardless of return being received.
For example if "m 0 100\n" is sent then the next command "m 100 1000\n" will not be processed correctly.
The workaround is to append lots of spaces after the command but before the "\n".


Added polling register and memory dump.


Reading the PDB into various internal data structures.


Done simple source file display when the address matches a known location, otherwise the memory is hex dumped.


Added a background thread that doesn't block the GUI.

Rearranged the command and receive routines so they block when needed.
*Or move the actual updates and logic to a separate thread and make the command fetch blocking, which would be easier to code for.


Added command !s and !sm
Command !s will dump registers and plain source files using the current PC.
Command !sm  will dump registers and mixed source files and disassembly using the current PC.
	Dump hex bytes and opcode disassembly for lines mixed in with source code.
	Using the previous address info it would be possible to go backwards a number of steps from the current PC.
	Then ask VICE to disassemble from that previous address to the PC, then PC to next addresses
	The disassembly at PC is important to be able to get the current PC disassembled properly even if the previous code is self modified to rubbish.
	Then merge the appropriate source file lines into the disassembly based on the addresses shown in the disassembly.
	*Can use startPrev and endNext ranges.



Label display.
Locals for the current zone, then the other zones back to the global zone 0.


Used labels check box.


Register view above the source view.


Added extra disassembly only view.


Need some kind of command queue and command result mechanism along with specific parsers for each command type.



ACME should output any include paths used in the PDB.
Parse and use the "INCLUDES:0<cr>files..." section of the file.



If the connection to VICE is lost then retry the connection until it succeeds.
Add a bit of UI to show when the connection is lost or connected.



Improved the mixed source disassembly display code to avoid multiple lines that are the same being displayed.



Make it possible to read more than one PDB file at the same time.



Link up mNextAddr/mPrevAddr when all PDB files are read.



Mixed disassembly and source mode now has better formatting where the information is all on one line where possible.



Mixed asm and source mode, all on one line?



* It would be possible to automate the collection of memmapzap and memmapshow information for a configured update frequency and use that to provide sampling profiling information
	Code/label/memory heat map
	Or update VICE to maintain this count of access types and report it back, to avoid so much memmapzap/memmapshow access
		addr: IO ROM RAM
		0000: -- --- rw-
		0001: -- --- rw-



* add more buttons for step over and step out on that one


* Recovering from remote debugger connection issues much better



* Highlight the current line in the source view - Grey background



* Remap known labels entered in the edit window to hex values for Vice to use
	Use the current, or last known, PC and zone to map backwards through the labels list to find the most likely label
	Handle missing '.' prefix as well



* Get a full memory dump from Vice at breakpoint and step
	Use it to give hints of label values in the label window
	Use it to give hints of label values in the source



* Binary remote monitor commands https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/vice/src/monitor/monitor_network.c#l182
	* Replace "!domem" with binary dump
		SendCommand("m 0 ffff");
		ParseMemory(theReply); gets a lot simpler



* Fixed a small bug in the binary transfer code



* Added better source file searching
	// MPi: TODO: Use mSourceIncludes
	mSourceIncludes is initialised with suitable data, but not used during filename searches yet...



* Register display larger to accomodate any APU debug view



* Add buttons for target display rendering: cls, full, ahead
	Useful for the BDD6502 hardware emulation, not used by Vice



* APU mixed source and disassembly view doesn't work when the PC is < $10



* Memory view. Simple dump for now.



* Need "delete breakpoints" button



* Fixed the annoying bug where the remote monitor sometimes locks up
